RGB has the following pattern: (R, G, B)
R means the amount of red, G the amount of green and B the amount of blue (as the accronym suggests red, green and blue). Each section can go from 0 up to 2⁸ -1 values, or 255. This allows for a combination of 255³ (16.777.216) colors.  
Formula rgb to hex:

Suppose you have RGB(201, 20, 60):

To turn RGB color to hex, work with each of the three components separately. Divide the first figure by 16: 201/16 = 12 + 0.5625 (remainder). Multiply the remainder by 16 (0.5625*16 = 9). To identify the hex format of every digit, you need to refer to this chart, which is also used to convert hex color to RGB

As you can see, 12 is C, while 9 is also 9. As a result, this color is expressed in hex as #C9.

Next, divide the second number by 16, too: 20/16 = 1 + 0.25. The remainder must also be multiplied by 16, which gives 4 (0.25*16). Now you know that the code looks like #C914.

Repeat the same division and multiplication for the third value (60). In this example, 60/16 = 3 + 0.75, while the remainder multiplied by 16 gives 12. Thus, the full code is #C9143C.
