Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

Examples:

// must return 2
cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200}); 
// must return 0
cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000}); 


1. get recipe properties
2. get recipe properties quantities
3. check yourIngredients to see if you have the necessary ingredients for the recipe 
4. if you have every ingredient then, check yourIngredients to see if you have the necessary quantities for each required Ingredient
5. if you have everything needed for the baking, then, check to see how many cakes can you make (yourIngredient - recipe ingredient)
